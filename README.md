# COPD-Machine-Learning
This is a project I worked for a local hospital in MD. 
The project aims to discover the key care pathways for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). 
The techniques used in this project includes regression, classification and association analysis.
The chanllege of this project is to use the workable machine learning algorithm to get some meaningful result from the limited and simple data set.
